This is an example of a Read Me. You'll use this to help give details on how your project works

## Formatting

### Headers
Using a # before text creates different headers in your project. Make sure to include a space between the text and the # You can do #, ##, ###, with the less meaning the bigger the header. Think of it as an h1, h2,h3.
Headers are also used as a table of contents for viewing this document on GitHub, so organize wisely!

### Linking
You'll definately need to link to different pages or branches in your document. Example
Open [My personal website](https://www.lukejonesblog.com/#/)
Start your link with square brackets [] then followed directly by paratheses ()

### List
Using a * will allow you to list
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

You can also do a numbered list
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

### Code Style
If you need to write out code, use `<h1>The carrot</h1>`. Do this by carrot, enter the text, then a closing carrot.

A more advanced version of this is calling the specific language. For example.
 ``` CSS
 .someClass {
  color: red;
}
 ```
 
 Do 3 carrots, and then close with 3 carrots.
