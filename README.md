# This is an example Read Me file
This is an example of a Read Me. You'll use this to help give details on how your project works

## Headers
Using a # before text creates different headers in your project. You can do #, ##, ###, with the less meaning the bigger the header. Think of it as an h1, h2,h3.
Headers are also used as a table of contents for viewing this document on GitHub, so organize wisely!

## Linking
You'll definately need to link to different pages or branches in your document. Example
Open [My personal website](https://www.lukejonesblog.com/#/)
Start your link with square brackets [] then followed directly by paratheses ()

If you need to write out code, use `<h1>The carrot</h1>`
